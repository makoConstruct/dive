I think nothing will be done with it, because the fractal turns out to be kind of useless: Zoom in on any position long enough and you'll end up in absolute black or absolute white. You can only stay in regions of complexity by actively pursuing complexity. Adding additional colors is impossible as the zones of complexity of the colors will quickly separate forever.
